# SportUP client

This is the client side of our last project at Ironhack - SportUP - [to app!](https://sportup-app.netlify.app/).

A short presentation about the project - [click me!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FKChSV9j9FMIUJGQxeNT3PMdYihqTrCzNXUGB67TmyA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Introduction

This is our final project at Ironhack Berlin - building a full stack application with
ReactJS on the front end and creating a RESTful API to serve the backend. The goal of our app is to
connect people who love sports, love being active, but might have found themselves in a new city,
or just their training partner is busy. We all know that training with a partner is better - you
achieve your goals faster, it's more fun and you keep each other sticking to a schedule!

Users can register, take a look at all the activities or create their own choosing from a list
of more than 15 sports. They can also follow other user's to quickly see what their activities
are. We wanted to create a simple, clean design that looks good on all resolutions and screen sizes.
